# Project3

###Technologies Used

Our main coding languages will be JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.  We will mount these on the Node.js + Express framework.  

We will use the jQuery library for JavaScript.  

We will use D3 for our data models.

The outside API we will be using is Yahoo Finance.  As a strech goal, time permitting, we will use StockTwits.

We will use tools such as Trello for user stories.  Git & GitHub for version control.  RoboMongo for database visualization.  Draw.io for wire frames and prezi.com for our pitch deck presentation.

We will use MongoDB for our database. 

###A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
We began by addressing the issue of volatility in the stock market.  An emerging trend in technology is prediction markets for which we found a great example in the arena of politics with www.predictit.org.  We decided to apply a similar concept to the stock market and see if we could create a web app that could predict daily stock behaviour using a mathematical concept called Wisdom of the Crowd.  

Once we established the central concept, we began drawing wireframes and ERD's.  

At the end of the day, we will begin to write code.

###Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome.
We currently have no unsolved problems and are probably very naive about the hurdles we are going to need to overcome.
